Learn more about about the provided samples, documentation, integrating the SDK into your app, accessing source code, and more at http://developers.facebook.com/ios.

NOTE: By default, the Facebook SDK for iOS is installed in ~/Documents/FacebookSDK. A simple way to test your install is to build and run the project at ~/Documents/FacebookSDK/Samples/JustRequestSample/JustRequestSample.xcodeproj.

GETTING STARTED

(Full steps with screenshots are available online at: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/getting-started/getting-started-with-the-ios-sdk)

1. Install Xcode (https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and, optionally, Git (http://git-scm.com/).

2. Install the Facebook SDK for iOS package (this SDK, which installs to ~/Documents/FacebookSDK).

3. Try the sample projects under the Samples directory.

4. Create a new Facebook App (https://developers.facebook.com/apps/) or use an existing App -- remember its Facebook App ID.

5. Create a new Xcode project
  -Drag the FBiOSSDK.framework from your SDK folder into the Frameworks section of your project. (Choose 'Create groups for any added folders' and deselect 'Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)'.)
  -Drag the FBIOSSDK.framework/Resources/FBiOSSDKResources.bundle into the Frameworks section of your project. (Choose the same settings as above.)
  -Add the "-lsqlite3.0" library to your Build Settings under "Other Linker Flags".
  -Place your Facebook App ID in your project's .plist under a new key called "FacebookAppID" (of type "String").
  -Create an "Array" type key in your .plist called "URL types"; make a single subkey of type "Array" called "URL Schemes". Add a single item called "fbYOURAPPID", replacing YOURAPPID with your Facebook App ID.

6. Start coding! Visit http://developers.facebook.com/ios for tutorials and reference documentation.
